## Getting started

1. When you're using Windows run this:
   - `git config --global core.eol lf`
   - `git config --global core.autocrlf input`

   **This will set the EOL (End of line) character to be the same as on Linux/macOS. Without this, our bash script won't work, and you will have conflicts with developers on Linux/macOS.**
2. Clone this repository.
3. Check your node version is >= than in `.nvmrc` file, recommend to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#intro)
4. Edit `/packages/i18n/locales/`{your locale(s)}/`messages.json`
5. In the objects `extensionDescription` and `extensionName`, change the `message` fields (leave `description` alone)
6. In `/.package.json`, change the `version` to the desired version of your extension.
7. Install pnpm globally: `npm install -g pnpm` (check your node version >= 22.12.0))
8. Run `pnpm install`

Then, depending on the target browser:

### For Chrome: <a name="getting-started-chrome"></a>

1. Run:
    - Dev: `pnpm dev` (on Windows, you should run as administrator; see [issue#456](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite/issues/456))
    - Prod: `pnpm build`
2. Open in browser - `chrome://extensions`
3. Check - <kbd>Developer mode</kbd>
4. Click - <kbd>Load unpacked</kbd> in the upper left corner
5. Select the `dist` directory from the boilerplate project

### For Firefox: <a name="getting-started-firefox"></a>

1. Run:
    - Dev: `pnpm dev:firefox`
    - Prod: `pnpm build:firefox`
2. Open in browser - `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
3. Click - <kbd>Load Temporary Add-on...</kbd> in the upper right corner
4. Select the `./dist/manifest.json` file from the boilerplate project

> [!NOTE]
> In Firefox, you load add-ons in temporary mode. That means they'll disappear after each browser close. You have to load the add-on on every browser launch.
